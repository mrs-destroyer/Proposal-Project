# _Project Title_
Timed Math Challenge


# _Introduction_
In Python, the time() function returns the number of seconds passed since epoch (the point where time begins).  In the above example, we have use the time. The time() function get the current time in seconds  and then print the result.In this function we use the time() to challenge us. That How much time we need to solove our question.


# _Project Objectives_
Using The timed math Module in Python. math is a built-in module in the Python 3 standard library that provides standard mathematical constants and functions. We can use the timed math module to perform various mathematical calculations.


# _Scope of Project_
Python's Timed math functions and the math module provide a robust set of tools for performing mathematical operations within Python programs. 


# _Estimated Time to Complete the project (ETA)_
In knowing, recognizing and writting it i took 9 to 10 hours. In every step i was need to run the program and cheak that  its work or not.
